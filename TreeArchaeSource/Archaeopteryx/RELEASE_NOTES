Changes from version 1.1 to version 1.2
---------------------------------------

- Corrected a problem in puzzle_mod/puzzle which caused it to fail to
  read in user trees in which on average all names where longer
  than 20 characters.

- Added about 50 species to the species tree (in particular Archaea and 
  Arthropoda).

- Rewrote "pfam2trees.pl" which is now called "xt.pl". This program is
  now better documented and supported.

- Improved "makeTree.pl".
