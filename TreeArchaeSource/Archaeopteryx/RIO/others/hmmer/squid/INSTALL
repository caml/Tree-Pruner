Brief installation instructions for squid
SRE, Tue Jul 25 08:52:03 2000
________________________________________________________________

For a source distribution (example: squid-1.7.tar.gz), on a UNIX system:

   gunzip squid-1.7.tar.gz   Uncompresses the archive.
   tar xf squid-1.7.tar      Unpacks the archive. 
                             (makes a new directory, squid-1.7)
   cd squid-1.7              Moves into the distribution toplevel directory.
   ./configure               Configures the software for your system.
   make                      Builds the binaries. 
   make install              Installs the software. (You may need to be root.)
   make clean                Cleans up.
 
The default is to install into /usr/local/bin and other /usr/local
subdirectories. If this isn't what you want, edit the top of the
Makefile; instructions are provided there for changing the
installation paths.

Any failure to install on a UNIX system is a bug. Please report it.

Man pages are provided for some programs; see Man/ subdirectory.
